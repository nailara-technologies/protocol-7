From: Guy <vclouds(at)gmail.com>
To: photon(at)nailara.net

Hi Alexander,
I received the payment. thanks!

here is the statement:

I, Guy Senderovich (VClouds) the creator of the "VClouds Weather Icons"
give Alexander Taute (photon) my permission to use the icons
in the "nailara" project commercially.

Hopefully this will suffice...

Best regards
Guy
