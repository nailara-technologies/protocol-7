=head1 NAME

Devel::REPL::Plugin::ReadLineHistory - Integrate history with the facilities provided by L<Term::ReadLine>

=head1 VERSION

version 1.003028

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin enables loading and saving command line history from
a file as well has history expansion of previous commands using
the !-syntax a la bash.

By default, history expansion is enabled with this plugin when
using L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu|Term::ReadLine::Gnu>. That means that
"loose" '!' characters will be treated as history events which
may not be what you wish.

To avoid this, you need to quote the '!' with '\':

  my $var = "foo\!";

or place the arguments in single quotes---but enable the
C<Term::ReadLine> attribute C<history_quotes_inhibit_expansion>:

  $_REPL->term->Attribs->{history_quotes_inhibit_expansion} = 1;
  my $var = 'foo!';

and to disable history expansion from GNU readline/history do

  $_REPL->term->Attribs->{do_expand} = 0;

=head1 CONFLICTS

Note that L<Term::ReadLine::Perl> does not support a history
expansion method.  In that case, you may wish to use the
L<Devel::REPL History plugin|Devel::REPL::Plugin::History> which provides similar functions.
Work is underway to make use of either L<History|Devel::REPL::Plugin::History> or
L<ReadLineHistory|Devel::REPL::Plugin::ReadHistory>> consistent for expansion with either the
L<Term::ReadLine::Gnu> support or L<Term::ReadLine::Perl>.
