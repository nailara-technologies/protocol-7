#  this directory keeps local copies of various perl modules that are
#  not up to date or problematic when installed using debian packages
#  or directly from CPAN ( i.e. X11::Protocol::Ext::RANDR [!] )
#
#  some modules might be modified to work arround issues / bugs
#
#  nailara agents will prefer them to regular @INC ones
