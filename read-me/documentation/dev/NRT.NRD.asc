 .:[ AMOS RESSOURCE TOKENS development notes ]:.

AMOS RESSOURCE TOKENS are the blockchain currency of the AMOS
PROTOCOL-SEVEN network.

the tokens are used to value ressources connected to the network and
transfer the corresponding value in transactions between users.

the value of one ressource token represents the ressources an average user
connects to the network. it is calculated as total ressources connected to
the network divided by total number of user accounts.

AMOS DROPS are sub-units of ressource tokens, 4200 AMOS DROPS have the value
of one amos ressource token. as tokens are also accounts, the drops are
accounted to tokens.

account values are represented by [signed] 13 digit numbers,

accounts themselves are described by 7 character wide AMOS-checksums
plus 32 octet C25519 public keys, as in '<CHKSUM><C25519-KEY>'.

the checksum is calculated over the following values : username
associated with the account and its creation date, the account creation
date and the public key, including a signature over the values with that
key. the dates are in nailara network timestamp format, as already present
with each account username to form a valid network account.

with these values assiciated users remain anonymized, yet have signed to
agree with the association and can also be asked to verify the validity
of the account and transaction intentions .,

AMOS-13 secret key generation..,

the C25519 keys required to sign transactions are generated from a
passphrase and a PIN number. the passphrase is used to seed an AMOS-13
encryption algorithm cipher stream, a division by 13 based entropy pool,
and the PIN describes how many iterations are required to arrive at
the secret key input data, which is derrived from a BMW [ blue midnight
wish ] and a Tiger digest hash that are fed by the cipherstream entropy.

that way it is possible to authorize transactions with a PIN to a seeded
algorithm at a public location without risking disclosure of the secret
key used to seed the cipher. the secret key is erased from memory after
seeding the entropy pool algorithm. the PIN is still required then to
run it in the correct iteration count, recreating the secret key for
each use. this way keys and PIN are never stored on persistent memory.

when the users device looses power the seed for the entropy pool is
lost and the passphrase will have to be entered again to seed the pool.

to authorize transactions then the PIN can be used again.

using this combination the account does not depend on any stored information
in contrast to other blockchain technology today.

issueing .., checksum over harmonic random value and harmonic last state
[ public key and a checksum over blockchain state and public key ] ..,

segmentize truth verification, 72 bit rows must be TRUE .,

all checks true, as numerical assertion and with elf modes 4, 7 and 13 ..,

from the last valid state a C25519 secret key can be derrived to sign the next
valid state. it can safely be publicly known, as only valid new states can
be signed with it, and once mass consensus requirements have been reached
it looses its value.

the next valid state includes a new public key of the created token, it is
an account of its own and only the user creating it [ as proof of work ],
has its secret key and transfer the value of the token [ or parts of it ]
elsewere.

valid are only public keys that ammend the old blockchain state to a new all
true state according to the verification rules. a signature of the old state
and the new pulic key needs also to assert as true.

as users connect more ressources to the network, but ressource prices become
cheaper over time, this provides a balance to the value of tukens in context
of issueing new ones.

ressource types within the network can be dynamically valued against each
other using the ressource tokens, depending on the current demand situation.
the proportion between the different ressource types does automatically
balances itself, indepentend of prices of tokens in other currencies.

that way tokens always remain useful within the network for ressource
interchange.

ressources in the network are anything from offered disk storage to
data traffic transfer or the processing of data in all kinds of workloads.

external blockchain currencies can also be traded against AMOS
RESSOURCE TOKENS which enables the free flow of ressources in and out of the
protocol seven network.

pricing would be determined by value of average ressources per user.
